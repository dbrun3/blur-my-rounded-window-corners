Patches for the [blur-my-shell](https://github.com/aunetx/blur-my-shell) and [rounded-window-corners](https://github.com/flexagoon/rounded-window-corners) gnome extensions and the Gnome Shell by @kancko (shell and original bms patch), @MeguMario (ui for blur radius controller) and @Shneegans (bms compatibility for rounded corners) with a small bug fix by myself.

I'll also be including the prebuilt extensions as a the releases which I'll be maintaining forks for each of the patches for [blur-my-shell](https://github.com/dbrun3/blur-my-shell) and [rounded-window-corners](https://github.com/dbrun3/rounded-window-corners) alongside the .deb files for the ubuntu version of the gnome-shell for anyone who just wants to install and go right away.
